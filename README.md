legs ðŸ¦µ
===

Legs is a simplified interface for [go-data-transfer](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-data-transfer),
providing a 1:1 mechanism for maintaining a synchronized [IPLD dag](https://docs.ipld.io/) of data between
a publisher and subscriber.

Usage

Creating a legs publisher is as simple as creating a `LegTransport` and starting
a publisher. `LegTransport` handles all the transport machinery to enable
the instantiation of several publishers and subscribers in the same libp2p host:

```golang
t, err := legs.MakeLegTransport(ctx, host, host, lsys, "legs/topic")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
publisher, err := legs.Publish(ctx, t)
...
// Publish updated root.
if err := publisher.UpdateRoot(ctx, lnk.(cidlink.Link).Cid); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

A subscriber to the same "legs/topic" would be created similarly 
```golang
t, err := legs.MakeLegTransport(ctx, host, host, lsys, "legs/topic")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
subscriber, err := legs.NewSubscriber(ctx, t, policy)
```
and can watch to changes via:

```golang
subscriber, err := legs.Subscribe(ctx, dataStore, lp2pHost, "legs/topic")
subscriptionWatcher, cncl := subscriber.OnChange()
go watch(subscriptionWatcher)

func watch(notifications chan cid.Cid) {
    for {
        newHead := <-notifications
        // newHead is now available in the local dataStore
    }
}
```

Subscribers can be created with a `PolicyHandler`. This policy is
used to filter the exchanges and updates a subscriber will process.
Subscribers started with `FilterPeerPolicy`, for instance, will only
process (and thus exchange) updates from the specific peer specified
in the policy.

Subscribers keep track of the latest head they've already synced
to prevent from exchanging all the DAG from scratch in every update, downloading
exclusively the part they're missing. This value is not persisted as part
of the library. If you want to start a subscriber which has already
partially synced with a provider you can use:
```golang
subscriber, err := legs.NewSubscriberPartiallySynced(ctx, t, policy, latestSync)
```
